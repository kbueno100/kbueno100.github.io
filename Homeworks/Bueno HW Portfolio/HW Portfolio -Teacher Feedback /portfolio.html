<!-- Kathrine, great job! Way to use CSS to style your page. I made some changes to your code above to reflect my suggestions. My full feedback's below:


- I noticed a few formatting issues in your code. Try and tab consistently for each new nested element. For example: 

<div>
	<ul>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
	</ul>
</div>

You'll hear me talk about this point a lot in class. Consistent formatting's an important part of writing readable code. Take a look at my changes above to get an idea of how you'll want your indents to line up.


- As document formatting goes, consider something like this in the future:

<body>
	<header>
		<nav></nav>
	</header>
	<main>
		<div>
			<p>text</p>
		</div>
	</main>
</body>

Good way to break your HTML into modules that are easy to manage. 

- Don't use <br> tags. If you're looking to create space btw two paragraphs, use two seperate <p> tags. Or, if you're looking to create space below an element, add a margin-bottom to that element using CSS. 

- Always have lowercase file names. So "about.html" instead of "About.html"

- It a good idea to place your css files in a 'css' folder, and your images in an 'img' folder. This'll be helpful when you start working on larger sites. I made those changes above. 

- Notice, now that we've placed your css file in the 'css' folder, to reach it we need to change your file path from  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> to, <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">. This tells your program to first look in the css folder, and to THEN look for the style.css file.


Good work! Looking forward to seeing future projects.

ZD
